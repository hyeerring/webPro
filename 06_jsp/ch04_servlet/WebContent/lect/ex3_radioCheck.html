	<fieldset>What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy
		text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
		the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
		unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
		specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
		leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It
		was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
		containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
		publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
		Ipsum.</fieldset>
